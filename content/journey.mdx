## Started

Everything started back when I was in 9th grade. At that time, I was really into video editing. It was something I enjoyed a lot — mixing clips, adding music, trying different effects. I didn’t realize it then, but that hobby helped me understand how much I loved creating things.

One day, while editing, I suddenly wondered:
“How do these apps actually work? Like… how does all this processing happen behind the scenes?”
That question stuck with me.

## Process (maybe?)

I got curious. I started searching online, watching YouTube tutorials, and slowly learning how software and applications are made. At first, I didn’t really know what I was doing. I just explored whatever looked interesting — HTML, JavaScript, UI design, and all sorts of random tech stuff.

Over time, I realized I wanted to go deeper. I wanted to build apps, not just use them. That’s when I started taking it more seriously — learning to code, trying small projects, and understanding how technology actually works.

Now, about two years later, I’m still learning. I haven’t achieved anything big yet, but I’ve made progress. I’m a lot more focused now, and I know what kind of path I want to take.

## My Dream

One of my goals is to get into a top university like MIT, Harvard, Oxford, or any place where I can grow and learn even more. I want to be around people who are passionate about technology and ideas, and I want to challenge myself to keep getting better.

Eventually, I hope to start something of my own — maybe a company, maybe a project — something that really contributes to the world through technology. I don’t have all the answers yet, but I’m excited to figure it out along the way.

This is just the beginning, but I’m ready for what’s ahead.
